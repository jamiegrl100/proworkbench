# Governance

Project status: **Preview (v0.1)**.

## Maintainer model
This project currently has a single maintainer.

## Decision making
- The maintainer is responsible for final decisions.
- Security boundaries (WebChat-only execution, social chat-only) are considered non-negotiable product constraints.

## Project direction
The goal is to ship a local-first, safe-by-default assistant that non-technical users can operate with confidence.

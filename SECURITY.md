## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not open public GitHub issues for security problems.

Include:
- a description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- impact assessment
- any proposed fix

## Supported versions
Only the latest Preview release is supported for security fixes.

## Scope notes
- PB is designed for local-only use by default (binds to `127.0.0.1`).
- Tools/MCP execution is WebChat-only; social channels are chat-only.

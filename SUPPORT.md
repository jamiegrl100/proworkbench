# Support

## Where to get help
- GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/jamiegrl100/proworkbench/discussions

When asking for help, include:
- your OS
- PB version (or git commit)
- whether Text Generation WebUI is running on `127.0.0.1:5000`
- Doctor report (copy support report) with secrets reviewed/redacted

## Support boundaries (important)
- PB is local-first. We support local usage and private network access (VPN/tailnet/LAN).
- We do not support exposing PB directly to the public internet.

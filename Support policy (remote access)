Support policy (remote access)

PB (Proworkbench) is designed as a local-first assistant: your models, tools, and data run on your own hardware, under your control. That design choice is intentional—it’s what enables PB’s “secure-by-default” posture (block-all tools, explicit approvals for risky actions, and clear visibility into what’s running).

Because remote exposure dramatically increases risk (and the number of ways a setup can be misconfigured), we have a clear support boundary:

What we do support

We support remote access only when PB is reachable exclusively over a private network that you control, for example:

A VPN / tailnet (e.g., Tailscale, WireGuard, ZeroTier)

A private LAN where access is limited to trusted devices/users

In these setups, PB is still not “public,” and access is constrained by:

your private network membership rules, and

PB’s own authentication/authorization model.

What we do not support

We do not provide support for exposing PB directly to the public internet, including (but not limited to):

port forwarding from your router to PB

opening firewall rules to “anyone on the internet”

public tunnels/funnels that make PB broadly reachable (especially without strict access controls)

“DM a link and anyone can access it” style deployments

These configurations are high risk and can lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or unintended tool execution. Even with good guardrails, public exposure creates a security and support burden that is out of scope for the project.

If you choose to expose PB publicly anyway

You’re free to experiment, but please understand:

this is at your own risk

we can’t troubleshoot or endorse internet-exposed deployments

we may close/redirect support requests that involve public exposure configs

Recommended best practice

If you need remote access, keep PB private:

use a tailnet/VPN,

restrict access to trusted devices/users,

and keep PB’s tool execution surfaces restricted to the web admin UI (as intended).

If you’re unsure whether your setup is “private network only,” ask in Discussions with a high-level description (no secrets), and we’ll help you confirm whether it falls within supported configurations.

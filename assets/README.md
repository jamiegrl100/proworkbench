# Assets

This folder contains repo assets used in GitHub markdown:
- `assets/banner.svg` is the README banner.
- `assets/screenshots/` contains screenshots referenced by the README and docs.

## Replacing placeholders
The current screenshots are SVG placeholders. Replace them with real screenshots (PNG recommended) using the same filenames:
- `assets/screenshots/doctor.png`
- `assets/screenshots/mcp-servers.png`
- `assets/screenshots/canvas.png`

Then update `README.md` and docs to point to the `.png` files instead of `.svg`.

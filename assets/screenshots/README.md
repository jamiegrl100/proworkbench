# Screenshots

Add real screenshots here and keep the filenames stable so README/docs links do not break.

## Required filenames
- `doctor.png` (Doctor page: all green example)
- `mcp.png` (MCP Servers page)
- `canvas.png` (Canvas page with at least 2 items)

## Recommended size
- 1200x675 (16:9) PNG
- Keep file sizes reasonable (aim under 1 MB each)

## Tips
- Hide tokens/secrets before capturing screenshots.
- Prefer capturing the UI with the left nav visible for context.

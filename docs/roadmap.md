# Roadmap

Project status: **Preview (v0.1)**.

This roadmap is intentionally high-level. Items may shift as PB hardens.

## v0.1 (Preview)

- WebChat
- Tools (policy + proposals + server-side execution)
- Unified approvals
- MCP templates and servers (15 presets)
- Doctor “Fix my setup”
- Canvas (persistent outputs)

## v0.1.1 (Hardening)

- Retention and cleanup controls
- More guardrails around risky operations

## v0.2 (Quality)
- Improved onboarding “first 5 minutes”
- Better provider/model selection UX
- More non-tech recovery flows

## v1.0 (Stable)
- Formalize plugin/tool ecosystem
- Stronger sandboxing and permission boundaries
- Installer + upgrades
